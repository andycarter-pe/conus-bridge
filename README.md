**Description**:  From entwine point cloud data served by the USGS 3DEP service, extract geospatial data from points classified as bridges over a requested goegraphical area.  These scripts were developed to get bridge limits such that they can be used to build a terrain that is a composite of the 'bare-earth' and the bridge deck data (healed terrain).  As a flood mapping surface, this 'healed surface would be used to determine when bridges are overtopped during a flood.

  - **Technology stack**: Scripts were all developed in Python 3.8.12.  Use is intended within a custom 'tx-bridge' [Anaconda environment](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).  <br><br>
  - **Status**:  Version 0.1- Preliminary release.  Refer to to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).<br><br>
